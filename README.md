This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## TIS-620 Decode Web

Online TIS-620 decode and encode.

### Project Story

When I was young, I wrote a diary in Notepad on Windows XP. Most of the characters were in Thai.

Recently, I had a change to recover my old external hard drive and found that file.
I was unable to read those characters. I researched online and discoverred it was a encoding issue.

To give a concrete picture, here is an eample:

TIS-620 input: "ÊÇÑÊ´Õ¤ÃÑº"
UTF-8 output: "สวัสดีครับ"

The issue is that the old Notepad saved my Thai characters with TIS-620 encoding, but modern Notepad read files using UTF-8 by default.

I created this project to help myself migrate that diary content to modern UTF-8.

## Technology Stack

- Next.js
- Radix UI
- Taildin CSS

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
